# ITU BDS MLOPS'25 - Project
This repository contains a project completed for the Data Science in Production: MLOps and Software Engineering course (Autumn 2025) at the IT University of Copenhagen.

It implements a full MLOps pipeline for training, evaluating, and deploying a machine learning pipeline using Python, Go (Dagger), GitHub Actions, and DVC. The pipeline is used to identify **potential new customers** on a website, using **user behavior data**.


## Project Overview
This main goal of this project was to refactor a Python notebook into a **machine learning pipeline**.

The pipeline handles **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, model selection and deployment**.  
The original notebook has been refactored into **Python scripts**, and the pipeline is containerized with **Dagger** and automated using **GitHub Actions**.

## How To Run the Project

### 1. Using GitHub Actions Workflow

The project can be executed entirely through GitHub Actions, which automates the full MLOps pipeline.

**Manual Trigger**
- Go to the repository **Actions** tab.
- Select the workflow named **"GitHub Actions Workflow"**.
- Click **Run workflow** and select a main branch to execute.
- Click **Run workflow**. 

The workflow will:
1. Checkout the repository and install dependencies.
2. Run the Dagger pipeline (go/pipeline.go).
3. Upload artifacts for download. 

After a successful run, the workflow automatically uploads:
- **training-artifacts/**: Intermediate artifacts.
- **model/**: The final deployed model artifact (named model).


### 2. Locally 
Make sure the following tools are installed on your machine:

- **Docker Desktop:** Must be installed and running (required by Dagger).
- **Go (≥ 1.21):** Used to run the pipeline orchestrator (go/pipeline.go).
- **DVC:** Used to pull the dataset from a remote source.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-root>
```
**2. Run the MLOps Pipeline**
From the repository root, run:
```bash
go run go/pipeline.go
```

This command will:
1. Start the Dagger engine
2. Pull the dataset using DVC
3. Run the following pipeline stages:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Model evaluation and deployment
4. Save all generated outputs to the local filesystem

**4. Verify the Output** 
After a successful run, the following directories will be created:
* **`mlruns/`:** Contains the local MLflow Tracking data and the Model Registry.
* **`artifacts/`:** Contains the final generated files, including `training_data_gold.csv`, and `model_results.json` etc.
* **`model/`:** Contains the final deployed model artifact, named `model.pkl`
