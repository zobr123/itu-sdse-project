# ITU BDS MLOPS'25 - Project
This repository contains a project completed for the Data Science in Production: MLOps and Software Engineering course (Autumn 2025) at the IT University of Copenhagen.

It implements a full MLOps pipeline for training, evaluating, and deploying a machine learning pipeline using Python, Go (Dagger), GitHub Actions, and DVC. The pipeline is used to identify **potential new customers** on a website, using **user behavior data**.


## Project Overview
This main goal of this project was to refactor a Python notebook into a **machine learning pipeline**.

The pipeline handles **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, model selection and deployment**.  
The original notebook has been refactored into **Python scripts**, and the pipeline is containerized with **Dagger** and automated using **GitHub Actions**.
